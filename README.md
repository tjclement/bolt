# A new tool to break stuff! ⚒️

![Curious Bolt picture](docs/images/bolt.png)

The Curious Bolt is a security multi-tool for getting started with hardware hacking. It is simultaneously:
- a programmable crowbar **voltage glitcher** ⚡️
- an **8-channel logic analyzer** 👩‍💻
- and a simple differential power analysis **oscilloscope**. 📉

## How do you turn this on?
See [Getting Started](docs/getting_started.md) for how to set up and use your Bolt.
